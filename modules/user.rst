.. note ::

    In the following examples, we will make use of JMSDiExtraBundle_, and
    SensioFrameworkExtraBundle_. This is by no means required when you implement
    this in your own application though.

.. warning ::

    We have completely left out any security considerations, in a real-world
    scenario, you have to make sure the following actions are sufficiently
    covered by access rules, for example by using @PreAuthorize from
    JMSSecurityExtraBundle_.

.. code-block ::

public class Test {}
